# Welcome

Hi, I’m **Lê Phan Khải Vinh**, a third-year student in Computer Science (Honours Program) at VNU-HCM - Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology. My goal is to become a software engineer specializing in system design, with a focus on high-performance architectures, robust data models, and modern deployment workflows. Beyond my studies and work, I stay active with badminton, enjoy reading, and unwind with music. I'm always happy to help, so feel free to reach out.
